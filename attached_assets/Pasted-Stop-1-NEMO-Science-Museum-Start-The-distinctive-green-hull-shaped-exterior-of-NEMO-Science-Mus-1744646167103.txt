Stop 1: NEMO Science Museum (Start)


The distinctive green hull-shaped exterior of NEMO Science Museum, perched over the harbor. We begin at NEMO Science Museum, the large green building shaped like a ship’s hull rising from the water. This striking structure was designed by famed architect Renzo Piano and opened in 1997​
en.wikipedia.org
. Renzo Piano wanted NEMO to evoke Amsterdam’s seafaring history – indeed, it looks like a giant ship emerging from the harbor​
wanderlustingk.com
! Standing here, you might imagine you're on the bow of a boat about to sail. NEMO is actually built atop a tunnel that runs under the water, and its roof doubles as a public square with cascading steps. Inside NEMO are five floors of hands-on science exhibits (the largest science center in the Netherlands​
en.wikipedia.org
), where kids and adults can experiment and play. If you have time after the tour, it’s worth a visit – you can blow giant soap bubbles or conduct electricity with a human chain! For now, let’s head up to the rooftop terrace. From the top, you get a panoramic view of Amsterdam’s old city center​
wanderlustingk.com
. Point out the spires and towers you see: in the distance, you might spot a tall white clock tower – that’s our next stop, the Montelbaanstoren. You can also see the busy harbor below, with boats and the replica 18th-century ship at the Maritime Museum nearby. Take a moment to soak in the view and snap a family photo with Amsterdam’s skyline. Pacing: We’ll spend about 10 minutes here to enjoy the view. Kids, try a fun challenge: can you count how many church towers you see from NEMO’s roof? (Hint: Look for the tallest one with a blue crown – we’ll see it later in the Jordaan.) When you’re ready, let’s continue. It’s about a 5-minute walk to Montelbaanstoren. Walking Tip: From NEMO, walk west along the pedestrian bridge and follow the waterfront path towards the small canal. Keep the water on your right. Montelbaanstoren – the old brick tower with a white steeple – will be straight ahead on the canal bank.
Stop 2: Montelbaanstoren (Medieval Tower)


The Montelbaanstoren tower on the Oudeschans canal, with its white clock tower added on top of the original brick base. Here we are at Montelbaanstoren, a picturesque 16th-century tower on the canal Oudeschans. This brick tower was originally built around 1512–1516 as part of Amsterdam’s medieval city walls​
commons.wikimedia.org
. Imagine back then: city guards stood watch here, scanning for enemy ships on the waterways. In fact, the tower’s base is one of the last remnants of Amsterdam’s old defensive walls​
commons.wikimedia.org
. As you look up, notice the upper section is a different color – the elegant cream-colored clock tower was added later, in 1606, to make the tower look more attractive when the walls were no longer used. Montelbaanstoren has a fun nickname: “Malle Jaap,” meaning “Silly Jack” in Dutch​
commons.wikimedia.org
. Why silly? Well, when the new clock and bells were installed, they had a mind of their own – the bells would often chime at odd hours or not at all, confusing everyone!​
commons.wikimedia.org
 The townspeople joked that the tower was a bit crazy, and the nickname stuck. You might share a laugh imagining the bell ringing in the middle of the night by accident, causing folks to check their watches. Ask the kids: What would you nickname a tower that rings whenever it wants? Silly Jack seems just right! This spot was also a gathering point for sailors in the 1600s​
commons.wikimedia.org
. In Amsterdam’s Golden Age, sailors would meet at the base of this tower before embarking on long voyages. Picture them in old-timey clothes, hugging their families goodbye next to this very canal. Perhaps a sailor’s children back then found comfort seeing the Montelbaanstoren – much like a lighthouse – as their father’s ship drifted away to sea. Storytelling tip for kids: Maybe a family of ducks in the canal “quacked” along when the bells misfired, giving the sailors a funny send-off! Today, Montelbaanstoren stands peacefully by houseboats and bikes, a reminder of Amsterdam’s maritime past. Take a look around: houseboats line the canal here, and locals relax on benches when the sun is out. It’s a great spot for a short rest. Feel the old brick wall of the tower – it’s over 500 years old! You are literally touching history. Pacing: Enjoy about 5 minutes here to snap photos. Kids can count the floors and windows on the tower or wave at any passing canal boat. When you hear the modern chime of the clock (it behaves nowadays, ringing on the hour), you’ll know time’s up to move on. Next, we head to Nieuwmarkt Square for lunch. It’s roughly a 5–7 minute walk from here. Walking Tip: Cross the bridge next to Montelbaanstoren and continue west down the street Sint Antoniesbreestraat. You’ll pass through a short street with shops and then arrive at an open square with a castle-like building in the middle – that’s Nieuwmarkt and the Waag.
Stop 3: Nieuwmarkt & Lunch at In de Waag


The medieval Waag building at Nieuwmarkt Square, once a city gate, now a cafe-restaurant (In de Waag), with its spires and red shutters. Welcome to Nieuwmarkt, a lively square that has been a center of commerce for centuries. In Dutch, Nieuwmarkt means “New Market,” and indeed markets have been held here since the 17th century when this area became a public square. The star of Nieuwmarkt is the Waag, the dramatic medieval building in the center that looks like a little castle with pointed towers. Believe it or not, this is one of Amsterdam’s oldest buildings – built in 1488 as a city gate known as St. Anthony’s Gate​
amsterdamredlightdistricttour.com
. Back then, Amsterdam’s city wall ran right here, and this gate allowed entry into the city (imagine huge wooden doors and a drawbridge over a moat!). When the city expanded, the walls came down, and by 1614 the moat around the gate was filled to create this market square​
en.wikipedia.org
. The old gate was repurposed as a weigh house, or “Waag,” where merchants would weigh and trade goods like grain and butter​
amsterdamredlightdistricttour.com
. If you look up at the building, you can still spot stone plaques and symbols of the guilds that used it: one tower was used by the blacksmiths’ guild, another by the masons, and even the surgeons’ guild had their meeting room here​
amsterdamredlightdistricttour.com
. In fact, a famous event took place inside: in 1632 the surgeons commissioned the artist Rembrandt to paint an anatomy lesson here – that painting (“The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp”) became world-famous​
mauritshuis.nl
! (Don’t worry, we won’t go into the gory details with the kids, but it’s a neat link to art history for the grown-ups.) Today the Waag hosts a café/restaurant called In de Waag – and it’s our lunch stop. 🥪 Fun fact: The Waag is the oldest non-religious building in Amsterdam​
amsterdamredlightdistricttour.com
. Sitting under its high medieval ceiling feels like dining in a castle. As you settle in at a table (perhaps under the soft candlelight they often have), imagine the hustle and bustle here 300 years ago: scales weighing cheese wheels, merchants haggling, and perhaps some townsfolk gossiping about that “Silly Jack” tower down the road. Ask your kids what they’d trade if this were a market in the old days – tulip bulbs? Spices? Or maybe their allowance for a stroopwafel? Take the time to enjoy some classic Dutch lunch fare. You could try pannenkoeken (Dutch pancakes) or broodjes (sandwiches). Perhaps order bitterballen (savory meat croquettes) for everyone to sample – kids often love these crunchy bites. Don’t forget a stroopwafel or apple pie for dessert as a treat! While you eat, you might point out the thick walls and heavy wooden beams of the Waag’s interior – reminders that this was once a fortified gate. It’s like eating in a time machine. Pacing: We suggest about 45 minutes to an hour for lunch here. Rest those legs and refuel. The kids can recount their favorite thing so far (maybe the silly tower or the cool rooftop) or see who can sketch the Waag’s shape on a napkin. There are also often street performers or market stalls in Nieuwmarkt (on weekends there might be a flea market or organic food market) – feel free to wander the square after eating. When you’re ready to continue, we’ll explore Amsterdam’s Chinatown just north of the square. The next stop, Zeedijk and the He Hua Temple, is a short 5-minute walk from Nieuwmarkt. Walking Tip: From the Waag, walk north across the square and take the street Zeedijk (pronounced “zay-dike”) heading towards a large Chinese-style gateway in the distance. You’ll notice Chinese shops and restaurants as we enter Chinatown.
Stop 4: Zeedijk and Fo Guang Shan He Hua Temple (Chinatown)


The Fo Guang Shan He Hua Temple on Zeedijk, with its ornate Chinese archway and golden roof tiles, in the heart of Amsterdam’s Chinatown. As we walk along Zeedijk, you might feel like we’ve traveled to a different country! Welcome to Amsterdam’s small but vibrant Chinatown. The street name Zeedijk means “Sea Dike” – centuries ago, this street was a dike holding back the waters of the IJ bay. Sailors from all over the world came ashore here, and in the 20th century Chinese sailors and merchants settled in this area, creating Chinatown. Look around at the shop signs – you’ll see Chinese characters, red lanterns, and perhaps smell the delicious aroma of stir-fry or steamed buns. 🍜 Kids, keep an eye out for a bakery selling mooncakes or the grocery with exotic fruits – it’s a feast for the senses! Right in front of us is the Fo Guang Shan He Hua Temple, the largest Buddhist temple in Europe built in traditional Chinese style​
en.wikipedia.org
. Its architecture is hard to miss: a grand entry with tiled green-and-gold roof, carved dragons, and a bright red façade. This beautiful temple, also known simply as He Hua Temple (荷華寺), was inaugurated in 2000 – even Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands came to open it officially on September 15, 2000​
chinatownology.com
. “He Hua” means “Lotus Flower” in Chinese​
chinatownology.com
, symbolizing purity. It’s also a clever nod to the Netherlands (荷兰 Helan is “Holland” in Chinese, using the same character “荷” for lotus). So the temple’s name connects the Dutch and Chinese cultures in one phrase – pretty neat! Take a moment to admire the intricate details on the temple’s exterior. The large red doors might be open during the day – if so, you are welcome to step inside quietly (just be respectful: turn off flashes, and note that photography may be limited). Inside, you’ll find a serene prayer hall with a golden Buddha statue and the smell of incense in the air. Even if you stay at the door, you can peek at the beautifully painted ceiling and the offerings of fruits and flowers left by worshippers. This is a working temple and monastery (you might see Buddhist nuns in traditional robes). It’s amazing to find such a tranquil, spiritual place in the middle of the busy city. For the kids, this is a great opportunity to discuss a bit about Buddhism – or just to marvel at how different the temple looks from the old Dutch churches we’ll see later. Ask them: What’s the most eye-catching thing here? The dragon statues? The bright colors? It’s like a scene from Mulan, right in Amsterdam! Step back outside and note the two stone guardian lions at the entrance, meant to protect the temple. Perhaps challenge the family: Can you find any animals or mythical creatures carved on the roof? (Hint: Dragons and phoenixes are common in Chinese temple art – see if you can spot one.) The temple often offers free guided tours and Buddhist courses; it’s a hub for the local community and also welcomes visitors to learn about Chinese culture. It stands as a symbol of Amsterdam’s famed tolerance and diversity, showcasing how people of many backgrounds live side by side in this city​
chinatownology.com
. On the same street, you’ll find an Asian supermarket, dim sum restaurants, and even Dutch pubs around the corner – a true cultural mix. Pacing: Spend about 10 minutes here to walk around the temple exterior and Chinatown block. If the kids need a sweet snack, you can pop into a Chinese bakery on Zeedijk for an egg tart or bubble tea. They might get a kick out of seeing Chinese zodiac animals on decorations or colorful posters for the next Lunar New Year festival. Our next destination is the historic heart of Amsterdam: Dam Square. It’s about a 10-minute walk from here. Walking Tip: Continue along Zeedijk which will curve and lead you out of Chinatown. You can follow street signs towards “Dam” or “Dam Square.” Essentially, head southwest: you might pass through a short pedestrian shopping street (like Nieuwendijk or Warmoesstraat). If you need a straightforward route, take Geldersekade south, then turn right on Nieuwendijk which leads directly to Dam Square. Keep an eye out for when the streets open up to a large plaza – that’s Dam Square, marked by a big white column (the National Monument) and the Royal Palace.
Stop 5: Dam Square (City Center & Royal Palace)


Dam Square on a sunny day, with the Royal Palace (center) and New Church (right) overlooking people gathering in the open plaza. Welcome to Dam Square, the very heart of Amsterdam. This sprawling plaza is often bustling with life – you’ll likely see street performers, pigeons fluttering about, locals on bikes cutting across, and tourists snapping photos. Take a 360° look: on one side stands the grand Royal Palace with its classical facade and green-domed tower, and next to it the Gothic windows of the Nieuwe Kerk (New Church). In the middle of the square is a tall white stone pillar – that’s the National Monument, a World War II memorial where people lay wreaths every May 4th to remember the fallen. All around are historic buildings, shops (Madame Tussauds is on one corner), and the energetic pulse of the city. It’s called Dam Square because this is literally where Amsterdam began – as a dam on the Amstel River in the 13th century. The city’s name, Amsteldam, comes from “dam on the Amstel.” Standing here, you’re on what was once a simple dam holding back river water. Over time it expanded into a central marketplace and the square you see now. If you feel the ground vibrate, that’s a tram going by – several tram lines cross Dam Square today, like arteries of the city bringing people in and out. Watch out for those silent bicycles too! This is a great spot for a short break. Let the kids chase (or gently feed) a few of the hundreds of pigeons – a classic Dam Square activity. Legend has it that if a pigeon lands on you, you’ll have good luck (though maybe not lucky for your clean shirt!). Let’s talk about the Royal Palace (Koninklijk Paleis) dominating the square​
iamsterdam.com
. It was built in the 17th century, not originally as a palace but as Amsterdam’s City Hall during the Dutch Golden Age. At that time, it was touted as the largest administrative building in Europe, even called the “Eighth Wonder of the World.” In the 19th century, it became a royal palace. Fun sight game: Look up at the very top of the palace. Can you see the statue of Atlas holding a globe on his shoulders? That’s from Greek mythology – Atlas holding up the sky. That statue is 6 meters tall (about 20 feet)​
paleisamsterdam.nl
​
en.wikipedia.org
! It’s amazing how small it looks from down here. Also notice the palace’s roof has a little tower with a weather vane ship – a nod to Amsterdam’s seafaring wealth. Although the Dutch royal family (King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima) doesn’t live here, the palace is used for official events and you can tour it at times. To the right of the palace is the Nieuwe Kerk (“New Church” – though it’s over 600 years old, called “new” only relative to the older Old Church elsewhere). It’s no longer used for regular services, but it hosts art exhibitions and royal investitures (Dutch kings and queens have been inaugurated there). If you peek that way, you might see the ornate carved entrance and tall stained glass windows. In the center of the square, the National Monument (a white obelisk with sculpted figures) stands since 1956 as a memorial​
iamsterdam.com
. On its steps you’ll often find people sitting and resting – maybe join them for a moment. This is a good time for a storytelling snippet for the kids: Imagine Dam Square in medieval times – it would be noisy with merchants selling fish and cloth, perhaps even the sound of cattle (there was once a weigh house here too, long gone). Now imagine it during WWII – soldiers and then the liberation celebration. And today, maybe a street musician is playing a tune. The square has seen it all. Interactive moment: If there’s a street performer – perhaps someone making giant soap bubbles or a human statue painted silver – pause and enjoy. These performers often love volunteers, so kids might get a chance to participate in a magic trick or catch a big bubble. It adds a bit of present-day magic to the historical aura. Also, you could play “I Spy” here: I spy something golden (hint: the palace clock hands and weathervane!), I spy something funny (maybe a costumed character like a living statue or a guy on stilts). Dam Square is full of surprises. Pacing: Spend about 15 minutes in Dam Square. It’s a perfect spot to use the restroom or grab a quick snack from a stand (stroopwafels or fries, anyone?). There are often food trucks or snack shops nearby. If the kids need a quick energy boost, Dutch poffertjes (mini pancakes) can be found around here sometimes – fluffy, sweet, and kid-approved. When you’re ready to move on, we’ll seek a quieter atmosphere just a few blocks away at the Begijnhof, a hidden courtyard. The walk is about 5–7 minutes. Walking Tip: Head out of Dam Square by walking down the Kalverstraat (a busy pedestrian shopping street at the southwest end of the square). After a couple of blocks of shops, turn right at a small street leading to Spui square (ask for directions to Begijnhof if needed, as it’s a bit tucked away). At Spui, find the Begijnhof entrance – it’s through an unassuming wooden door/archway at #30 Spui. It might feel like you’re entering a secret garden (because you are!).
Stop 6: Begijnhof (Secret Courtyard of the Beguines)
Stepping through the gate into the Begijnhof is like entering a tranquil oasis hidden from the city buzz. Please remember to speak softly here, as this is a private residential courtyard. Take in the scene: neat lawn and gardens, surrounded by a ring of historic houses with gabled roofs, some brick, some with big windows, all beautifully kept. In the center stands a small white chapel. It’s hard to believe noisy Kalverstraat is just a minute away – in here, you might only hear birds chirping or the faint bell of a distant tram. Encourage the kids to tip-toe and use their “indoor voices” as we explore this peaceful spot. It feels a bit like Narnia’s wardrobe – one step and we left modern Amsterdam for a hidden medieval world! The Begijnhof (pronounced “beh-hine-hof”) was founded sometime around the 14th century (perhaps around 1346)​
en.wikipedia.org
. It was a community for the Beguines – pious women who lived in a sisterhood here. These women were not nuns (they didn’t take permanent vows), but they lived a semi-religious life devoted to charity and prayer, while still participating in the world. Think of them as an early girl-power community – they were independent, unmarried women in an age when that was uncommon​
amsterdam.info
. The Beguines supported themselves (some were nurses, some made lace or taught children) and they could leave to marry if they chose. The last Beguine lived here until 1971, remarkably​
en.wikipedia.org
! So this courtyard was in continuous use by Beguines for over 600 years. Today, single women (not Beguines) still reside in these houses, preserving the tradition of a women’s sanctuary. Look around for the oldest wooden house in Amsterdam. Along one side of the courtyard, you’ll notice a black-painted house with white framing (Begijnhof #34). That is the Houten Huys, dating from around 1420​
amsterdam.info
. It has a gothic wooden facade and is one of only two wooden houses left in the center of Amsterdam (wooden buildings were largely banned in 1521 due to fire risk​
amsterdam.info
). It’s incredible that this house survived the city fires; if you imagine it, this humble dark house has stood here while the world changed around it – from the days of knights and plagues to the age of smartphones. If it’s visible, point it out to the kids and explain it’s made of wood whereas most other buildings are brick or stone. Perhaps say: This house is like the “last of the Mohicans” – one of the very few wooden houses left from old Amsterdam! On the opposite side, you’ll see a tall house with a clock gable – and maybe notice a plaque or sign. This is the site of the English Reformed Church, originally built in the 15th century. During the Reformation in the 16th century, the Beguines (who were Catholic) lost their church, which was given to English and Scottish Presbyterian worshippers. The Beguines then built a clandestine Catholic chapel in one of the houses around the court (the little chapel with the brown doors, which you might peek into if open). This tells a story of how history changed things here: Amsterdam became officially Protestant, but the Beguine Catholics quietly continued their faith in hiding. Encourage the family to soak in the fairy-tale atmosphere. Perhaps each of you can pick a favorite house and imagine living there. The houses have different styles – some have those classic Dutch stepped gables, some have fancy neoclassical facades. Many have year markers and inscriptions. See if the kids can spot the oldest date on a facade. One house says “Anno 1575,” another might say 1671, etc. There’s also a statue of a Beguine in the garden – a woman in a long robe. It could be fun to do a quick role-play whisper: Pretend to be medieval Beguines walking in the courtyard, discussing the price of bread or tending to the poor. It spurs imagination about how life might have been here with women in long gowns and wimples (head coverings). Historical tidbit for context (optional to share): The Begijnhof is also famous for a miracle: the Miracle of Amsterdam (1345). A holy eucharist wafer was said to have miraculously not burned in a fire, and a Beguine woman played a role in preserving it. This made Amsterdam a pilgrimage site for a time. Even today, an annual silent procession passes through the Begijnhof to commemorate that event. This might intrigue the adults; for kids, you could simplify: There’s a legend of a “Miracle Bread” that wouldn’t burn – people thought it was magic. Pacing: Spend about 10 minutes here, walking the loop of the courtyard. There’s a lot to look at quietly. Perhaps count how many houses encircle the yard (around 47). Notice the well in the center (kids might think of it as a wishing well – toss a coin if you like, but quietly!). It’s really like stepping back to the 1600s. When you exit (through the same door or the side gate that leads to Gedempte Begijnensloot), we’ll make our way to the Canal Belt and the Nine Streets – a totally different vibe with canals, bridges, and boutique shops. It’s about a 5-minute walk to reach the first of the “Nine Streets.” Walking Tip: From Begijnhof, exit onto Spui and cross the street into an alley leading west. Essentially, we want to get to Herengracht or Singel canal and then into the “Nine Streets” (De Negen Straatjes) area. You can walk west down Gedempte Begijnensloot and then turn right on Singel canal. Immediately you’ll start to see the canal and the cute shops – we’re entering the Nine Streets.
Stop 7: The Canal Belt & The Nine Streets (Grachtengordel)
Now we find ourselves amid Amsterdam’s famous Canal Belt, a UNESCO World Heritage site of concentric canals dug in the 17th century. Take a look at the view down the canal – it’s postcard-perfect: water reflecting the sky, arched bridges decorated with flower boxes, and rows of narrow, tall canal houses shoulder-to-shoulder. Amsterdam has 165 canals totaling over 100 km​
starboardboats.nl
, which is why it’s often called the “Venice of the North.” But fun fact: Amsterdam actually has more bridges than Venice (around 1,500 of them!). The canals were not just for beauty – they served as transport highways and helped expand the city in a planned way during the Dutch Golden Age. We are in the Nine Streets (De 9 Straatjes), a charming grid of (you guessed it) nine little streets connecting the main canals. These streets have quirky names like Hartenstraat (Heart Street) and Berenstraat (Bear Street). Historically, many were named after the leather tanners and other trades that operated here (for example, Huidenstraat means “Leather Street”). Today, the Nine Streets are filled with cozy cafés, vintage boutiques, art galleries, and design shops. It’s a shopper’s paradise and a lovely area to wander. The kids might not be into boutique shopping, but there are toy stores and an old-fashioned candy shop somewhere around here if you look – and plenty of spots for a treat. Keep an eye out for a cheese shop with free samples – those are always a hit! 🧀 As we stroll, notice the architecture of the canal houses. Most are narrow and tall, often 3-4 stories, with ornately shaped gables (the top part of the facade). Why so narrow? Because historically, houses were taxed on their width along the canal, so people built slender homes to save money. (Kids, imagine if your house’s tax was based on how wide your front door is – you’d build a skinny house too!) Some houses here are extremely narrow – the narrowest house in Amsterdam is about as wide as a door! These tall houses often lean slightly forward and have a hook or beam at the top. Look up and you’ll spot hoisting hooks on many gables​
reddit.com
. They are functional: since staircases inside are very tight and steep, people use those hooks to hoist furniture and goods up through the windows​
reddit.com
. You might even catch someone moving a couch via the window – it still happens regularly. It’s a real-life physics lesson: pulleys at work! Ask the kids to imagine hauling their bed or bike up with a rope and hook – it’s how Amsterdammers have done it for centuries. Walking through the Nine Streets, enjoy the canal vistas at each crossing. We’ll likely cross three main canals: Herengracht (Gentlemen’s Canal), Keizersgracht (Emperor’s Canal), and Prinsengracht (Prince’s Canal). Each intersection offers a classic view – be sure to take a family photo on a bridge with canal and bikes in the background. Maybe even do a funny pose imitating the crooked houses (some old houses tilt due to settling ground). One fun activity: count the bicycles parked on the bridge. Amsterdam has more bikes than people – about 800,000 bikes! You’ll see them chained everywhere, like an explosion of two-wheelers. And unfortunately, a lot end up in the canals – roughly 12,000–15,000 bikes are fished out of the canals each year​
npr.org
. Imagine scuba divers picking up rusted bicycles from the canal floor – what a job! (Kids usually get wide-eyed at that fact – it’s both funny and a bit sad for the poor bikes.) This area is also great to point out the typical Dutch lifestyle along canals: people actually live in those canal houses and even on the water in houseboats moored along the sides. Houseboats often have plants and chairs on their decks – a floating front yard. The canals are alive – you might see locals kayaking, families on small motorboats cruising by, or ducks paddling in formation. Amsterdam’s canals are clean enough that you’ll even spot fish or the occasional daring person swimming (though probably not in cooler months). It’s a perfect time to appreciate how the city’s design – with water and land intertwined – makes it so unique and beautiful. Feel free to wander into a cute shop if something catches your eye. There are vintage clothing shops where teens find cool jackets, a camera museum or two, art bookstores, and specialty boutiques selling Dutch design items. For the kids, maybe pop into a sweet shop for a quick treat – Dutch drop (licorice) is famous (though be warned, the salty kind is an acquired taste!), or get a fresh warm stroopwafel made in front of you – the chewy caramel syrup between waffle layers is delightful. Pacing: Enjoy about 20 minutes strolling the Nine Streets and canal belt. This is more free-form; follow your curiosity. Cross a couple of bridges, say hello to friendly dogs being walked, maybe mimic the ringing of a bike bell with your voice whenever you cross a street (to remind the kids to watch for bikes). The pace here is leisurely. After the history and busy square, this is a chance to relax and absorb Amsterdam’s charm. Our final stretch will take us into the Jordaan district, ending near the Westerkerk and Anne Frank House. The Jordaan is adjacent to where we are – just further along the Prinsengracht canal. It’s about 10 minutes walk to reach the Westerkerk. Walking Tip: Continue west along Prinsengracht (the outermost of the three main canals we mentioned). You’ll know you’re going the right way if the house numbers are increasing and you pass the house number 263 – that’s the Anne Frank House address (we’ll see it in a moment). Head toward the tall church tower with a crown – that’s Westerkerk.
Stop 8: Jordaan District – Westerkerk and Anne Frank House (End)
We conclude our tour in the Jordaan, one of Amsterdam’s most beloved neighborhoods. The Jordaan has a cozy, village-like atmosphere with narrow streets, art studios, and cafés with tables on the sidewalk. It was built in the 17th century as a working-class district for artisans and immigrants. Nowadays it’s very trendy, but you can still feel the authentic charm – people chatting from their doorsteps, flower boxes in windows, and maybe someone strumming a guitar on a doorstep. Street names here are often flowers and trees (you might see Elandsgracht, Bloemgracht – bloom = flower). Some say the name Jordaan comes from the French word "Jardin" (garden), reflecting these floral street names or the gardens that once were here. In any case, the area is bloomin’ lovely. Towering above us is the Westerkerk (Western Church), with its blue crown-topped spire reaching 85 meters high. This is the tallest church tower in Amsterdam. The blue crown is the symbol of Emperor Maximilian of Austria, who gave Amsterdam the right to use his crown in its coat of arms as thanks for support centuries ago. The Westerkerk was completed in 1631 and Rembrandt van Rijn – the famous painter we talked about – is buried somewhere inside (in an unmarked poor man’s grave, as he died in poverty)​
en.wikipedia.org
​
iamsterdam.com
. The church is still in use and if you’re lucky to be here on the hour, you’ll hear its beautiful carillon bells play. These are the very same bells that a young girl named Anne Frank listened to and found comfort in during one of the darkest chapters of history​
iamsterdam.com
. Just a few steps away on Prinsengracht 263 is the Anne Frank House (Anne Frank Huis). It’s the preserved canal house where Anne Frank, a Jewish girl, hid with her family and four others during World War II to escape Nazi persecution. They remained hidden in a secret annex for two years (1942–1944), and during that time Anne, then a teenager, kept a diary that has since touched millions of hearts around the world. It’s a poignant place to end our tour, reflecting on hope and history. From the outside, the Anne Frank House looks like any other canal house – tall, narrow, with big windows (blinds likely drawn). The entrance to the museum is next door. If you plan to visit inside, remember tickets must usually be bought in advance for a timed entry. But even from outside, you can discuss Anne’s story with the family in an age-appropriate way. For the kids (10 and 12 are often already reading Anne’s Diary in school or will soon), you might say: In this house behind us, a girl named Anne lived hiding quietly for over two years, and she wrote in her diary about her hopes, fears, and everyday life in hiding. Point out the attic window where Anne could see a chestnut tree and the Westerkerk’s clock tower. Anne wrote about hearing the Westerkerk bells and how they cheered her up: “Father, Mother and Margot still can't get used to the chiming of the Westertoren clock... Not me, I liked it from the start – it sounds so reassuring, especially at night.”​
compassionjuli.wordpress.com
 Standing here, you might even hear those same bells ring, bridging the past to the present. It’s a powerful moment. Anne and her family were eventually discovered and deported; Anne died in a concentration camp in 1945, but her father survived and published her diary. Emphasize the message of her story: even in terrible times, a young girl’s voice made a difference and continues to inspire people to treat each other with kindness and to value freedom. It’s a sobering topic, but an important piece of what Amsterdam remembers and teaches. Next to the Anne Frank House is the Westerkerk plaza, often filled with people waiting to enter the museum. There’s a statue of Anne Frank nearby – a small bronze figure of a girl with a schoolbag. The church and the house together create a scene of reflection: the church symbolizing the city’s continuity and the house reminding us of the stories that must be told. Perhaps have the family take a quiet moment here. Even kids can understand the basic idea of someone having to hide because others were mean to them, and why we never want that to happen again. It can open a gentle conversation about tolerance and courage. On a lighter note to finish, the Jordaan area around us is also known for its music – it’s the birthplace of many Dutch folk songs. Sometimes on weekends, you might hear someone singing old Dutch tunes in a café or see locals having a jovial market. The Noordermarkt (a bit up the street) hosts organic farmer’s markets and flea markets. It’s this blend of culture – from Anne’s legacy to Rembrandt’s resting place to everyday Dutch living – that makes the Jordaan special. Pacing: Take 10 minutes or as long as you like to absorb the atmosphere. If you have time and the church is open, consider climbing the Westerkerk tower (the Westertoren) for a grand view – teens might love that, though note the stair climb is steep and usually guided. There’s often a short line and a small fee, but the panoramic view of Amsterdam’s roofscape is unforgettable, with the bells up close (just be sure to cover ears if they ring!). Alternatively, end with a treat: there’s a famous ice cream shop around the corner on Prinsengracht, perfect to end the tour on a sweet note. 🍦 As our walking tour ends, take a moment to appreciate how much ground (and history) we’ve covered: from science to centuries-old towers, from medieval squares to peaceful courtyards, through lively markets and quiet canals, ending with the echo of Anne’s diary by the Westerkerk’s bells. Amsterdam is a city that wears its history openly, yet with a youthful, friendly vibe – much like the mix of stories we heard. We hope you and your family have enjoyed this journey through time. Before we say goodbye, ask everyone: What was your favorite stop? Maybe the kids loved the NEMO rooftop or the crazy clock tower, or perhaps they’re intrigued by Anne Frank’s story now. The adults might cherish the serene Begijnhof or the beauty of the canals. There’s something for everyone in Amsterdam. Thank you for walking with us on this family adventure. Tot ziens! (See you again) – and enjoy the rest of your time in Amsterdam, whether you spend it biking along canals, visiting museums, or simply relaxing with stroopwafels in hand. Safe travels and keep exploring! 🥰🚲🌷
