This striking structure was designed by famed architect Renzo Piano and opened in 1997. Renzo Piano wanted NEMO to evoke Amsterdam's seafaring history â€“ indeed, it looks like a giant ship emerging from the harbor! Standing here, you might imagine you're on the bow of a boat about to sail. NEMO is actually built atop a tunnel that runs under the water, and its roof doubles as a public square with cascading steps. Inside NEMO are five floors of hands-on science exhibits (the largest science center in the Netherlands), where kids and adults can experiment and play.";
