The Royal Palace was built in the 17th century, not originally as a palace but as Amsterdam's City Hall during the Dutch Golden Age. At that time, it was touted as the largest administrative building in Europe, even called the 'Eighth Wonder of the World.' In the 19th century, it became a royal palace.";
