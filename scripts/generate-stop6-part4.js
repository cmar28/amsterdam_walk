They weren't nuns, but they were religious and helped take care of sick people. Can you spot the oldest wooden house in Amsterdam? It's over 600 years old and painted black with white trim! Look at how the houses face inward to this peaceful garden, like they're hiding from the busy city. It's incredible that this humble dark house has stood here while the world changed around it â€“ from the days of knights and plagues to the age of smartphones.";
